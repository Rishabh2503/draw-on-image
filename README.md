## Development Challenges & Solutions

### Canvas Scaling Issues
**Challenge**: The canvas drawing coordinates weren't aligning with the mouse cursor, especially on different screen sizes.

**Solution**: Implemented proper scaling calculations using `getBoundingClientRect()` and maintaining aspect ratio:javascript
const rect = canvas.getBoundingClientRect();
const scaleX = canvas.width / rect.width;
const scaleY = canvas.height / rect.height;
